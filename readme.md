# PROJECT IRIS

Welcome to Project Iris! This is a Python virtual assistant that is designed to help make your life easier. Iris is always ready to assist you with any tasks or questions you may have, all you need to do is wake her up by saying "Iris" followed by your query.

## Features

Iris is a powerful virtual assistant that can do the following:

- Answer general knowledge questions
- Search the internet for information
- Set reminders
- Create to-do lists
- Open and search your favorite websites
- Play music
- Control your smart home devices (if connected)
- And much more!

Iris is constantly learning and improving, so be sure to check back often for updates and new features.

## Installation

To install Iris, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies using the following command:

    pip install -r requirements.txt 

This will install the following libraries:

- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
- playsound
- openai

## Getting Started

To get started with Iris, run the **iris.py** file in your Python environment. Once you have Iris up and running, you can wake her up by saying "Iris" followed by your query. You can ask Iris anything you want, and she will do her best to answer your question or perform the requested task.

## Configuration

Before using Iris, you will need to configure your OpenAI API key. To do this, simply edit the line 21 of **iris.py**, and add your OpenAI API key as follows:


    openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

You can obtain an OpenAI API key by signing up for an account at <https://beta.openai.com/signup/>.
